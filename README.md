# Python-Dutch-National-Flag-Problem

## Task Description
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

## Explanation
0 and 2 are inserted in their correct positions, which places all the 1s in correct position automatically. 
Then, sorting is done in a single traversal to make the code very efficient. 

Time Complexity: O(n) for traversing the unsorted list to sort

Space Complexity: O(1) - Actions are performed in the given list and no new data structure is used.
